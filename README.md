# Hello-world
First repository

This is the first branch I created for the very first repository. I will use this repository to 
start a journey of web developement. I recall there is one blog recording her 180 days daily development of 
HTML/CSS/Javascript, from total beginner to experienced. This is what this repository is about. 

I will start to learn web development from front-end to full stack.

In order to motivate and have a clear purpose, I will build a website 
Here is the overview of plan:

1st 30 days, I will focus on HMTL/CSS --> Bootstrap --> Less, to build a nice looking static website 
2nd 30 days, I will focus on Javascript/Jquery to build interactive website 
3rd 30 days, I will add back-end support using ASP.NET

I think everyday,I should spend 1 hour to work on it everyday, and 6 hours during weekends. so totaly hour is = 90 hours + 12*6 = 160 hours which is equivalent to 4 weeks in full time. It is managable I think.

After 3 months, I should be familiar with all these basics, and now I will build a website for work purpose:
This project should take 2 months:
This wil be a data-driven website with table view and graph view, getting data from ADO.NET. Most of work should be on back-end, leanring database and server and deploy.

After this project, I will build a real-time communication and data-driven report website. This is light-weighted SaaS. This should resemble "collara.co". This project should take another 3 months as I might also need to learn Angular.js.
